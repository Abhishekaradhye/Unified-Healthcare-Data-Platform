# Main Readme file

Dorectories 'UNIFIED_DATA' & 'UNIFIED_APIS' are soul of the repository. 

UNIFIED_DATA contains data used & UNIFIED_APIS includes py files used. 
Special mention to format.ipynb notebook file in which I loaded the created files from dropbix, assumening coming from a client, went through them, converted each file pandas dataframe, one by one filtered and made it usable and sophisticated, compared it with other similar data dataframes for uniformity or structure such as unncessary columns and their combinaitons to be split and strudtured well enough to be usable in future use. 

In 'UNIFIED_APIS' directory, I have stored py files that do API calls to resource, per domain of data there. Executing the files will show streamlit UI there one can enter the primary key and see relevant results of api call.
